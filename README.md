# A Node and Ruby Docker image for CircleCI

A Docker image including both Node and Ruby for a CircleCI runner. So you can
build your mixed Node and Ruby projects (Jekyll, Node with Sass, and so on).

The image is based on the pre-built CircleCI [lastest Node image](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/#nodejs).

We simply add [Ruby](https://rubygems.org) and [Bundler]().
